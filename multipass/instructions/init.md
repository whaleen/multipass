# multipass Init

Guide the user through a complete multipass setup. Follow each step in order,
stopping to report errors and attempt remediation before proceeding.

## Step 1: Check Python version

Run `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on Windows) and confirm the
version is 3.9 or higher. If Python is not found or the version is too old,
tell the user they need Python 3.9+ installed and stop.

## Step 2: Check if multipass is already installed

Run `pip show multipass` to see if the package is already present. If it is,
report the installed version and skip to Step 4.

## Step 3: Install multipass

Run `pip install multipass`.

### Error handling -- pip failures

If `pip install multipass` fails, try these fallbacks in order:

1. Try `pip3 install multipass`
2. Try `python -m pip install multipass` (or `python3 -m pip install multipass`)
3. If the error mentions missing build tools or compilation failures (commonly
   from chromadb or its native dependencies):
   - On Linux/macOS: suggest `sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev`
     (Debian/Ubuntu) or `xcode-select --install` (macOS)
   - On Windows: suggest installing Microsoft C++ Build Tools from
     https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
   - Then retry the install command
4. If all attempts fail, report the error clearly and stop.

## Step 4: Ask for project directory

Ask the user which project directory they want to initialize with multipass.
Offer the current working directory as the default. Wait for their response
before continuing.

## Step 5: Initialize the ship

Run `multipass init <dir>` where `<dir>` is the directory from Step 4.

If this fails, report the error and stop.

## Step 6: Configure MCP server

Run the following command to register the multipass MCP server with Claude:

    claude mcp add multipass -- python -m multipass.mcp_server

If this fails, report the error but continue to the next step (MCP
configuration can be done manually later).

## Step 7: Verify installation

Run `multipass status` and confirm the output shows a healthy ship.

If the command fails or reports errors, walk the user through troubleshooting
based on the output.

## Step 8: Show next steps

Tell the user setup is complete and suggest these next actions:

- Use /multipass:mine to start adding data to their ship
- Use /multipass:search to query their ship and retrieve stored knowledge
