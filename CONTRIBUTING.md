# Contributing to multipass

Thanks for wanting to help. multipass is open source and we welcome contributions of all sizes — from typo fixes to new features.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whaleen/multipass.git
cd multipass
pip install -e ".[dev]"    # installs with dev dependencies (pytest, build, twine)
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

All tests must pass before submitting a PR. Tests should run without API keys or network access.

## Project Structure

```
multipass/          ← core package (see multipass/README.md for module guide)
hooks/              ← Claude Code auto-save hooks
examples/           ← usage examples
tests/              ← test suite
assets/             ← logo + brand
```

## PR Guidelines

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-thing`
2. Write your code
3. Add or update tests if applicable
4. Run `pytest tests/ -v` — everything must pass
5. Commit with a clear message following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat: add Notion export format`
   - `fix: handle empty transcript files`
   - `docs: update MCP tool descriptions`
   - `refactor: simplify room detection flow`
6. Push to your fork and open a PR against `main`

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) with 100-char line limit (configured in `pyproject.toml`)
- **Naming**: `snake_case` for functions/variables, `PascalCase` for classes
- **Docstrings**: on all modules and public functions
- **Type hints**: where they improve readability
- **Dependencies**: minimize. ChromaDB + PyYAML only. Don't add new deps without discussion.

## Good First Issues

Check the [Issues](https://github.com/whaleen/multipass/issues) tab. Great starting points:

- **New chat formats**: Add import support for Cursor, Copilot, or other AI tool exports
- **Room detection**: Improve pattern matching in `room_detector_local.py`
- **Tests**: Increase coverage — especially for `knowledge_graph.py` and `ship_graph.py`
- **Entity detection**: Better name disambiguation in `entity_detector.py`
- **Docs**: Improve examples, add tutorials

## Architecture Decisions

If you're planning a significant change, open an issue first to discuss the approach. Key principles:

- **Verbatim first**: Never summarize user content. Store exact words.
- **Local first**: Everything runs on the user's machine. No cloud dependencies.
- **Zero API by default**: Core features must work without any API key.
- **Ship structure matters**: Wings, corridors, and rooms aren't cosmetic — they drive a 34% retrieval improvement. Respect the hierarchy.
